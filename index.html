    <h1 style=color:red >GITHUB AND CI/CD - INTRODUCTION TO <br>GITHUB (LAB 1)</h1>
    <h2 style=color:blue >EXPLAINATION</h2>
    <p>In this task, I first created a folder (ArchOSC Assignment). I then created another folder named “Pictures” <br>and placed it in it. I then took a screenshot of inside of my newly created lab folder, including the "Pictures" <br>folder which I created. I pasted it into paint, made the necessary editing and saved it to my "Pictures folder" <br>and that is showed below.</p>

    <p>Secondly, I opened a Windows terminal in my “ArchOSC Assignment” folder and took a screenshot of it as instructed. <br>I then added the screenshot of the terminal showing that I have created a local repository (repo) in my ArchOSC <br>Assignment by entering the git init command to your pictures folder and updated it in the “Picture” folder. <br>This is illustrated below.</p>

    <p>Third, since I already have a github account, I created a github repository and set to the name ArchOSC Assignment <br>where my local repo would be linked to. The git ignore has also been set to visual studio indicated below.</p>

    <p>Next, using the terminal, I created a link between my local repository and the one on GitHub, this will allow me to <br>push my local changes to GitHub when I have completed them. I have added a screenshot of my terminal showing <br>the addition of my GitHub repository as a remote repository to my pictures folder. This is also shown here:</p>

    <p>Furthermore, I created a basic website using the HTML in Visual Studio code. To make things clear, I named the it <br>index.html. When the site is opened, it takes you to the page shown below.</p>
    <img src="C:\Users\961100\Workspace\yep\Pictures\Screenshot 2026-02-03 124044.png">
    <p>The index.html file and the Picture folder have both been added to the github repository and committed through the <br>terminal.</p>
    <img src="C:\Users\961100\Workspace\yep\Pictures\Screenshot 2026-02-03 125932.png">
    <p>All related files in my local repo have been named, branched and push to github (online respository).</p>

    <p>Since practicing for the first time resulted in a few mistakes, corrections were made to put everything else in order <br>shown in the image below</p>

    <h2 style=color:blue >REFLECTION</h2>
    <p>In this lab, I learned how to set up and use GitHub as a version control and hosting platform for a simple website. <br>I created a new repository, configured it correctly with a README and .gitignore, and then built a basic HTML <br>webpage saved as index.html. I used Git commands such as git add, git status, and git commit to track my files <br>locally before pushing them to GitHub with git push. I also learned how to manage branches and ensure my local <br>repository matched GitHub’s structure. After uploading my files, I enabled GitHub Pages to deploy the website publicly, <br>allowing it to be accessed from anywhere via a web link. Finally, I improved the webpage with basic HTML and CSS <br>changes, added images and text from my working document, and documented each step with screenshots.
    <br>This lab demonstrated how GitHub is not just a storage platform but a powerful tool for managing projects, tracking changes, <br>and deploying work efficiently. In industry, these skills are essential for software development teams where <br>multiple people work on the same project. Version control prevents loss of work, keeps a history of changes, and <br>allows collaboration without conflict. The ability to deploy a website through GitHub Pages also shows how developers <br>can quickly publish updates and share results with clients or team members. Overall, this process reflects real-world <br>workflows used in software engineering, DevOps, and web development, where code is developed locally, <br>managed through Git, and deployed through cloud-based services.
